# Spark-E2 Skin

This skin is based on MetropolisHD originally included on Taapat Enigma2 OpenPLi5 image.

I just love Spark GUI and Azplay appearance. So, I made some sort of edition to the skin to make it look alike those two. But, not really is similar. I choose the best appearance to my liking and would like to share it with everyone.

Let me show you couple of screenshots:

You can do whatever you like with the skin. It's then yours actually, but please don't blame me when you got greenscreen or what my Indonesian fellows say "Koloran" or "Kolor Ijo".

Have fun!
